# Value Propositions

## Common issues:
- communication: word of mouth
- credit/cash: cash preferred by vendors and certain customers (more community-oriented), others (e.g. college students) prefer paying in credit
- budget: most have no budget, within reason 
  - emphasized that the market is expensive --> don't want to display prices though because that might hurt the vendors 
- purchases: split between buying groceries and buying only food 
- transportation: difficult – both getting there and parking
- purpose: socializing (overwhelming majority), shopping/eating (fewer), community
- vendors: regulars have relationships and others don't but have expressed interest in keeping contact
- time spent: once a semester, once every weekend,... 
- suggestions:
  - inventory + locality
    - where items are, where vendors are, where/when specialty items are found 
  - centralized information about vendors (including contact)
  - accept card/discounts
  - vendor relations
  - more eco-friendly
  ** inventory & information ** 

## Key problems:
Vendor relations: Talking to the frequent and infrequent visitors of the farmers market taught us that there's a huge emphasis on the community aspect of the farmer's market. Frequent visitors tend to have a few close relationships with vendors whereas infrequent visitor said that they wished they could keep in contact with certain vendors, especially after the farmers market season is over. Currently, there isn't a great way for patrons to remember which vendors they visited or to keep in contact with them after their visit. In addition, frequent visitors of the market claimed that they would frequently return to the same vendors but would be missing out on a lot of different ones, especially since a couple of them cycle through every week. From the vendor's perspective, vendors don't have much success with different strategies of attracting customers and instead, expressed that word of mouth was the most effective form of communication. This falls into how we might want our app to achieve its persuasive design goal – how might we facilitate patrons to share their favorite vendors with their friends?

## Value propositions (v1 initial version): 
1. Having inventory lists allows vendors to highlight specialized items and users to pre-plan their visits.
2. Many interviewees expressed interest in continuing relations with vendors beyond the market season and emphasizing vendor information will help facilitate and develop these relations. It will also allow users to provide feedback to the vendors.

## Updated value propositions (v2 Final Version):
1. Many interviewees expressed interest in visiting new vendors that they do not normally visit at the market and potentially making relationships with different vendors across the market. We know this through our discovery interviews, which showed us that current partrons either strongly value the relationships they have with vendors or are looking to get to know different vendors a little better. Patrons therefore are in need of a way to explore different vendors in order to extend their reach in the Ithaca farmers market community, and potentially be prompted to start building a relationship with some of the vendors that they meet. The cost of adopting this application is very low in reality.  

The primary cost is that vendors would need to be on board with our application, meaning that they would need to be willing to have scanable QR codes at their stands as well as accept that they will be having to interact regularly with new customers, wether it be allowing them to take pictures of their booth or engaging with conversation with the customers.  This is a low-cost to the vendors, though, as QR codes are incredibly accessible and easy to display, and through our interviews with vendors at the market, we found that they are actually looking for ways to connect with more customers, so this app would be a low-to-no-cost way to replace things that they are currently attempting to attract business, like ads in local papers.  For the patrons of the market, who are our primary users, this also comes in at little to know cost to them, as the majority of patrons already have access to smartphones which they could leverage to use our application for free.  The only cost they would have is the time and effort that it would take to visit different vendors which, given the fact that they are at the market and looking to visit different vendors, is essentially nothing! Alternative solutions may require some other sort of purchase/membership fees or just not provide a direct way to accomplish the users goal, which would cost the user more time and effor.  No alternatives we uncovered in our solutions space analysis would be as low-cost in this sense as our application!

Some of these alternatives are business cards for vendors or a more general website like the Ithaca Farmers Market website, but these are both more costly than our app.  Business cards for the vendors would cost more than having a singular QR code at their stand (same with ads in local papers like mentioned earlier) and using the Ithaca Farmers Market Website would cost users more time and energy, as it is less effective at prompting users and providing them with a clear way to visit new vendors than our app is.
