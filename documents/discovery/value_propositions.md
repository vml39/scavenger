Common issues:
- communication: word of mouth
- credit/cash: cash preferred by vendors and certain customers (more community-oriented), others (e.g. college students) prefer paying in credit
- budget: most have no budget, within reason 
  - emphasized that the market is expensive --> don't want to display prices though because that might hurt the vendors 
- purchases: split between buying groceries and buying only food 
- transportation: difficult â€“ both getting there and parking
- purpose: socializing (overwhelming majority), shopping/eating (fewer), community
- vendors: regulars have relationships and others don't but have expressed interest in keeping contact
- time spent: once a semester, once every weekend,... 
- suggestions:
  - inventory + locality
    - where items are, where vendors are, where/when specialty items are found 
  - centralized information about vendors (including contact)
  - accept card/discounts
  - vendor relations
  - more eco-friendly
  ** inventory & information ** 

Key problems:
1. Inventory
2. Vendor information

Value propositions: 
1. Having inventory lists allows vendors to highlight specialized items and users to pre-plan their visits.
2. Many interviewees expressed interest in continuing relations with vendors beyond the market season and emphasizing vendor information will help facilitate and develop these relations. It will also allow users to provide feedback to the vendors.
