<!-- Produce a scenario for each key problem/value proposition -->
<!-- Recall that a scenario = user + task + context. -->

# Value proposition 1
Allowing the user to choose 1 of 3 tasks in order to level up in the game, in order to build vendor relations.

# Scenario 1
Jonathan frequents the Ithaca Farmer's Market and is a frequent user of our app. He is wandering around the market with his friends browsing the items. He has been to the market a few times already and knows a couple vendors, but is still relatively unfamiliar with most of them. He uses this app to find new ways to facilitate new conversations with various vendors, such as the "speak to a new vendor" task. After doing so, he levels up and gets a badge. He realizes he really likes this vendor's products, and ends up favoriting the vendor in the app.


# Value proposition 2
Allow the user to see a list of vendors and favorite the ones they have visited and liked. This not only allows them to remember which vendors they like and want to visit again, but will be helpful in the "referral" tasks of some of the levels, where they will need to refer a vendor to a friend.


# Scenario 2
While Emily is playing the game, one of the tasks she must complete to level up asks her to scan the QR code of a new vendor. She decides to do so with Indian Creek Farm- while she is doing that, she ends up striking up a conversation with the vendors, and they tell her that they are selling a special type of mushroom that is only here for a limited time, and only sold by a few vendors. She is intrigued and thus buys the mushrooms. When she goes home and eats them, she absolutely loves them. She wants to remember this vendor for the next time she goes to the market, so she opens up the app and goes to the list of vendors, where she then favorites Indian Creek Farm by clicking the star next to it.
