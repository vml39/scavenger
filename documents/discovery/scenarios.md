# Scenarios (v1)

## Value proposition 
Having inventory lists allows vendors to highlight specialized items and users to pre-plan their visits.

### Scenario 1
Jonathan frequents the Ithaca Farmer's Market and carries quite a bit of produce expertise compared to many of the other market-goers. As a result, he absolutely loves going to see all the specialty items that various vendors sell for a limited time. On Saturday, he visited and found a vendor that sold a special type of grapes. He purchased them being intrigued, and when he tried them he absolutely loved them. So he went onto the farmer's market web app, and looked through  the vendors' inventory lists. There, he found that one other vendor also sells this special type of grape. So when the next weekend came, he went to the farmer's market and stopped at those two vendors' stands first, so that he could buy the special type of grapes from both vendors to see which he liked better for future reference.

### Scenario 2
When Emily is at the market, she visits the Indian Creek Farm booth and really likes that they sell a unique type of mushrooms. She tells the vendor she'll be back next week but the vendor warns her that the mushrooms usually sell out by 10:00 am on Saturdays. She makes a note about it in the app and when she opens the app to check the hours of the market the following week, is reminded that she needs to be there by 10:00 am. She's able to visit the farm before their mushrooms sell out again.

# Scenarios (v2)

## Value proposition
Many interviewees expressed interest in continuing relations with vendors beyond the market season and emphasizing vendor information will help facilitate and develop these relations. It will also allow users to provide feedback to the vendors.

### Scenario 1
Jonathan frequents the Ithaca Farmer's Market and is a frequent user of our app. He is wandering around the market with his friends browsing the items. He has been to the market a few times already and knows a couple vendors, but is still relatively unfamiliar with most of them. He uses this app to find new ways to facilitate new conversations with various vendors, such as the "speak to a new vendor" task. After doing so, he levels up and gets a badge. He realizes he really likes this vendor's products, and ends up favoriting the vendor in the app.

### Scenario 2
While Emily is playing the game, one of the tasks she must complete to level up asks her to scan the QR code of a new vendor. She decides to do so with Indian Creek Farm- while she is doing that, she ends up striking up a conversation with the vendors, and they tell her that they are selling a special type of mushroom that is only here for a limited time, and only sold by a few vendors. She is intrigued and thus buys the mushrooms. When she goes home and eats them, she absolutely loves them. She wants to remember this vendor for the next time she goes to the market, so she opens up the app and goes to the list of vendors, where she then favorites Indian Creek Farm by clicking the star next to it. 

### Scenario 3
Teresa bought a bottle of pear cider from a vendor named Birdwood Cidery at Ithaca Farmer's Market on Sunday. She went home and found that the cider tasted extremely good, so she wanted to buy two more for a dinner party that she would be holding on Thursday (before the next farmer's market). She then went on to the farmers market web app and found the vendor and their contact information. She called the vendor and was told that she could also buy the cider from the cidery itself, which is located 12 miles away from Ithaca. Therefore, Teresa drove to the Cidery on Monday and bought two more bottles of the pear cider, which she joyfully shared with her friends and family on Thursday.
