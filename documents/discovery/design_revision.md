    - Rationale – Vivian

1. How do we make this app less disjoint?
2. How do we make the app less like a website and more like the app?
  - How will it benefit the user?
3. How will we influence persuasive design?

- Engage with user instead of giving them information (get rid of the search bar)
- Could be inventory or vendors --> which one corresponds more with our user's needs and goals? 
- Practical problems with user needs 
  - Not all user's needs can be satisfied in the scope of this project 
  - Focus on a small problem 

**Focus on vendors**
- Meets needs of people wanting to explore more vendors
- Getting vendors more customers (no way to advertise)
- Referral system
- Include inventory under vendor? 
  - Acknowledging that we can't address _all_ of our user's needs
- Gamification
  - Badges
    - "Friend of the market" --> encouraging the community aspect
  - Leaderboard 
- Can assume infrastructural changes
- Self-motivated system
- Think of this as a piece of software, with the assumption that users know the general information and inventory 

- Want to: **introduce customers to new vendors**
- How to:
  - Referral
    - Create a text message or email (automatically adds points)
  - QR code to track if a patron has visited a vendor 
    - Adds to point bank 
  - Incorporate social media 
  - Complete inventory for each vendor 
    - e.g. pick up a piece of produce from this vendor, arts&crafts from x vendor
    - switch out vendors weekly
    - a map and you have to hit milestones at each map
    - levels --> choice is up to the user but give options
    - offer different options to complete a task
    - level up animation 
  - every week, you have new goals as well
  - think of Starbucks app
