1. Present your target audiences (users)


- Our target audience is people who enjoy going to the farmer's market, but don't have a particularly strong relationship with the vendors

- in our discovery phase we found in multiple interviews that frequent farmer's market attendees derive a lot of enjoyment at the market from the relationships they made with other vendors.  A couple interviewess made relationships with vendors and even had the opportunity to do business with them outside of the market, which they very much enjoyed

- other interviewees, though, struggled to make connections with vendors at the market as they weren't quite regulars of the market, but were looking for a way to get engage with the people of the market and try as much as they could

- So our target audience became that group of users - who enjoy the farmers market, but for one reason or another, have struggled to explore all the market has to offer and make connections with vendors



2. Show your implemented final app

Start with a walkthrough of the map/progress ~could say something like this~:

- "This map(whatever we call it) has nodes on it which represent tasks that a user has to complete to level up"
- If the user completes all of the tasks that they can see on this screen they level up
- each time a task is completed the (icon representing the user) moves onto the next task
- To complete a task, the user can select one of the task options on the left when their icon is sitting on a node (maybe go over the different tasks)
- and when the task is completed, they move onto the next one
- once finished, the screen moves and they level up
- and although this was beyond 


Talk about the vendors aspect and fav vendors:

- We also have a vendors page, where user's are able to get the information of a vendor that they visited after they completed a task with that vendor.  
- they can see information on the vendor's phone number, email, and even what kind of payment they take at the market for future reference.
- additionally, if a user really likes a vendor that they had to visit, they can "like" the vendor and have it added to their "favorited vendors" list






3. Explain how our design meets the needs of our target audience


The primary need of our target audience is that they explore different vendors.

- We are providing users with an application that prompts them to do tasks at the market geared around checking out different vendors.  

- These tasks revolve around exploring different vendors (e.g. take a picture with a vendor you never visited before, buy this product from this vendor, post about a vendor on social media, etc.).  

- The users will be persuaded to complete these tasks as we are implementing a leveling-up system for our users.  Each time the user completes a task they advance in their level and after completing three tasks in the level, they "level-up".  

- The user's level is displayed on the screen so that they always see what their level is and each time they advance a level, the level change is displayed on the screen.  Each level will represent a different status or level of experience at the market (e.g. beginner, regular, friend of market, etc.).  

- Our design fulfills the needs of our target audience by motivating users to explore different vendors, because they will want to complete the tasks given to them, so that they can level up.  

- Additionally, it gives users the ability to explore different venodrs because the taks given to the user may force the user to either (a) stop by a vendor they never went to before or (b) require them to interact with vendors on a deeper level than just purchasing a product off of them.
