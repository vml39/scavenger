user looks at this for a short period of time when going to the market

Navigation:
- bottom --> intuitive on a phone

Laying out information:
- too much info? 
- looking at solution space, here's how ithaca's site organized it
- gallery --> related to events? 
  - click under to see event coming up
  - have images in the background, use images to split up space but not gallery bc on phone 
- special events 
- site homepage; when user sees the site, need general info such as hours, location, special events; then have other info like parking, activities, pictures 

Displaying inventory:
- display more information? 
- modal
- phone screen
- show/hide
- how to organize? lay out? shopping site? 
- search bar, filter, or categories 
- tags
- by item? 
- item shows vendor

Personal account page:
- take a note from inventory and add to shopping list 
- make notes, diff kinds of notes (choose a subject, add info) 

Gamification:
- trivia 
- levels
- points for visiting / referring --> doesn't incentivize enough

Vendor account:
- where to log in --> separate admin page (only let vendors know)
