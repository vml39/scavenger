# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

2. To what goals do we all commit?

We all are splitting the responsibilities evenly, and making sure everyone is working on multiple areas. Also we are all committed to facing any roadblocks to accomplish our goals, and will not sacrificing our designs just for an easier route. 

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)



4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?



5. How will we communicate and work with our users?

We decided to revisit this point later. It's hard to say at this moment because we don't currently know who are users will be.

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

- Designers & developers: Since we agreed that each person should have experience in both designing and developing the app, we decided that for each feature, team members would be assigned either the designer or developer role so that no one is doing only one task. 
- Communication liaison: Once we know who our client or our target users are, we will designate a communication liaison responsible for keeping in contact with our client/users. 
- Meeting facilitator: A different person each week will be in charge of setting the agenda for the group meeting and will keep the group on track.
- Branch integration: One person will be in charge of integrating the feature branches into the master branch for each milestone.

7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
- technically, scrum boards, code reviews, task items.  Using gits tools and scrum's project manager
- formalize it as much as possible
- if someone is late or misses a deadline, address that as a team

- When a team member is not contributing equally or failing to deliver, we will make sure that we sit down and have a discussion as a team.  
- If there is a valid reason for failing to meet the contribution expectations it is fine, but we just need to communicate to each team member that if there is a reason that they cannot meet the expectations at a particular point, to let the team know as soon as possible. 
- If there isn't a valid reason we will need to go back over the contribution expectations for this project as a team.


8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
- have team discussions in which everyone that has a thought on the matter is heard
- see if we can come up with some sort of compromise from that open discussion
- if not compromise can be reached, we would go with the decision that has support from the majority of group members
- keep things professional and courteous.  There's no need to make disagreements personal or aggressive. 


9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?



10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
