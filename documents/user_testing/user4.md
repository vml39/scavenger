# Debrief
Went over with user each task one by one afterwards to show how we intended the user to act.  Then they provided their feedback and we moved to the next user task in a similar fashion.
1. You're going to the market this weekend and you need to check what time the market is open.
    * user felt the information was not as clear/distinct on the index page.
2. You really want carrots and you want to see which vendors will sell them.
    * felt that there could be confusion on what "inventory" and "vendors" options could mean
3. Make a note that you need to be at Indian Creek Farm next week at 10 am.
    * user wonders why this feature is necessary given they can make a calendar reminder on the phone.
4. You really like this vendor, Apple Farm, that sells apples. You want to find their contact info so you can ask them about their apple cider recipe
    * liked that searching was an option rather than alphabetically scrolling
5. Make a note that you like this vendor's squash too.
    * Felt the note button was not clear enough.
    * They were confused if the note button would just store/favvorite contact info of the vendor or allow them to add supplementary details.
6. Find out which vendors sell onion and take note of it.
    * Didn't know if click vendor names on item card would open vendor contact card
    * as per design intentions, this task was done incorrectly.
    * User felt steps weren't clear enough
