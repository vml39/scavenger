User: Tiffany Chen, junior studying ILR, goes to the farmers market more for a social activity.

1. You're going to the market this weekend and you need to check what time the market is open.
  - user hesitated for a second, then found it on the home page
2. You really want carrots and you want to see which vendors will sell them.
  - hesitated, clicked on inventory first
  - tapped on the vegetable category
  - seemed very confused and didn't know what to do
  - clicked on carrot farm instead of carrot image
3. Make a note that you need to be at Indian Creek Farm next week at 10 am. 
  - user found notes easily and completed the task
4. You really like this vendor, Apple Farm, that sells apples. You want to find their contact info so you can ask them about their apple cider recipe.
  - clicked on vendors 
  - found the apple vendor at the top of the page
5. Make a note that you like this vendor's squash too. 
  - clicked on note but was a little confused
6. Find out which vendors sell onion and take card.
  - clicked on inventory page, found onion
  - completed task easily

User feedback:
- slightly confused by the notes
- asked what someone would do if they didn't know what category an item was in for the search
- found it a bit overwhelming between having the inventory and vendors page, and when asked to find certain things, she wasn't sure which to go to first. Ultimately found the two's overlap a bit confusing
- labels on inventory page seem like buttons 
- suggested a centralized search bar in nav

Summary/redesign choices:
  - Importance of search functionality inventory and vendor pages
  - Reconsider the flow between vendor and inventory
  - Redesign the vendor modals and add vendor inventory (if possible)
