User: Senior AEP Major, patron of Farmer's Market

1. You're going to the market this weekend and you need to check what time the market is open.
    - he started on the vendors page and didn't think to press the home button to find the hours
    - just looked around for a little bit but then gave up
2. You really want carrots and you want to see which vendors will sell them.
    - he was up in the air on whether he should go to inventory or vendors
    - his initial thought was to go to the venodrs page.  Once he navigated there, he realized that it was not the right way
    - then he navigated to the inventory page
    - once on the inventory page, he completed the rest of the task with ease
3. Make a note that you need to be at Indian Creek Farm next week at 10 am. 
    - done with ease
    - clicked notes, clicked new note, made note.
    - only thing was that he didn't press the add note button at first.  Thought that hitting enter should register it, realized its a mobile app and said that should be fine.
4. You really like this vendor, Apple Farm, that sells apples. You want to find their contact info so you can ask them about their apple cider recipe.
    - done well
5. Make a note that you like this vendor's squash too. 
    - his initial thought was to go to the notes page and just manually create a note
    - I prompted him "is there any other way you could do this" and then he saw the "Note It" button and interacted with that
6. Find out which vendors sell onion and take card.
    - done with no issues.

Main takeaway:
- to the user, it was not clear hen he should use the inventory page vs the vendors page to get to where he needed to go.  It made him confused throughout the test.  
- Could be a good idea on the vendors page to add a "filter by..." button that indicates to the user that they can filter out vendors, like we've said we should have. 
- In the event of task two, instead of going to the vendors page and then realizing there was nowhere to go on this page, he could've hit "filter by..." and filtered by vegetables to find the ones who sell carrots.
