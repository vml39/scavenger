User: Eileen Zhou, senior studying AEM, patron of the Ithaca Farmers Market.

1. You're going to the market this weekend and you need to check what time the market is open.
  - user finished the task easily, at the top of the home page it lists the hours for Saturday and Sunday
2. You really want carrots and you want to see which vendors will sell them.
  - clicked on inventory 
  - tried to search first, but was not a part of the prototype
  - tapped on the vegetable category
  - page is confusing and doesn't know where to click 
  - clicked on carrot farm (instead of the image of the carrot)
3. Make a note that you need to be at Indian Creek Farm next week at 10 am. 
  - user found notes quickly and completed the task with no issues
4. You really like this vendor, Apple Farm, that sells apples. You want to find their contact info so you can ask them about their apple cider recipe.
  - clicked on vendors tab
  - tried to search again but found the apple farm on the top of the page
5. Make a note that you like this vendor's squash too. 
  - clicked on note it but stated she was confused because it seems like you're trying to note the contact info 
6. Find out which vendors sell onion and take card.
  - clicked on inventory page and found onion
  - had prior knowledge of how to do this because of the carrot task

User feedback:
- what is the purpose of the notes? 
- importance of search: what if you don't know what category an item is in? 
- on the inventory page, suggested that instead of displaying a partial list of the vendors that sell this item on the "shopping" view, have the number of vendors that sell this item instead
- the labels on the inventory page seem like buttons --> want to convey that it's the image that's clickable 
- initially when asking to look for onion or carrot or a specific vendor, suggested a centralized search bar in the nav bar 
  - discussed the idea that we're encouraging our users to browse as well
- having vendors as a modal in the list of vendors should garner more information â€“ have an image of the farm, list of inventory, contact info
- to facilitate browsing, list the popular vendors or inventory

Summary/redesign choices:
  - Importance of search functionality inventory and vendor pages
  - Redesign the way inventory items are displayed
    - Change vendor names to # of vendors that carry this item
    - Change labels so they don't look like buttons, make image appear like button
  - Redesign the vendor modals
    - Add vendor's inventory
  - List popular vendors or inventory
