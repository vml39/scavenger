Kyle Harms is a lecturer at Cornell in the Information Science department. He is a regular patron at the farmers market and visits the market each week to buy fresh produce. He gets excited over the specialty produce and has built relationships with several vendors. He approaches the market in two different ways: first, to get his weekly groceries – he wishes that sometimes, he could just look up an item and find it easily. Other times, he likes to wander around the market and is incentivized by finding the specialty items.

Kyle Harms (limitation: knows user-centered design, consider bias)
- 36, lecturer
- goes to the market because need fresh produce for the week 
- doesn't want to spend over $40 on produce but is actually an impulse buyer
  - there's specialty produce that you might not know about until you get there 
  - keeps his own garden
  - ex. when cherries go into season, 4 weeks of early cherries but 1 weekend of specialty cherries (very expensive but only there for a week, so will spend money on this)
  - you don't always know there's something special at the market, need to walk slow and be inquisitive 
- farmer's market is really big, only a handful of vendors he has a steady rapport with (black currant, black diamond farm, peppers)
  - will ask vendors when sees something he doesn't know (but acknowledges type a personality)
  - vendors very receptive to build rapport with clients, will always go to the same vendor for certain items 
  - went to the market one day for apples, then came back with more cash the next day to buy the rest of the apples
  - if you know the vendors, they will work with you to meet outside of the market (go to the farm)
  - need to know the time & place for certain produce (strawberries from 9-9:15 on saturday) --> regular occurrence --> the people at the market at this time are there for a reason
  - knows a lot about the market and about the places 
- would like to know that a specialty item might be at the market because it'll get him to go to the market
- always use cash at the market, don't trust the credit card companies/financial industry
  - credit card company did nothing for this local merchant who's just trying to scrape by, credit card company now gets money from the purchase 
  - pays cash so money will stay in the community and will go to the vendor 
  - vendors definitely prefer cash
  - really dislikes people at the market paying with credit card, lines are really long and it's annoying 
- going to the market is social time for him and husband 
  - if need something at the market, then will go alone 
  - social time -- eat food, sit and chat, sit by the dock, walk by the vendors, run into friends
  - will sit down almost every time but always after purchasing food
- likes to take friends who have never been to the market
  - friend is usually overwhelmed – crowded – but afterwards, experience is always positive
  - really enjoy time there, community aspect, likes uniqueness of items there (weird specialty stuff you wouldn't get elsewhere)
  - cousin felt meh about the market, speculates that she doesn't like to spend a lot of money (both produce and meals) and doesn't cook much for herself 
- established routine 
  - parking is madness so will park in the lot behind Aldi's and walk in 
  - if you know that you have to be somewhere at 9 because there's a line, make a beeline for it; otherwise, 
  - struggle with remembering what this produce looked like and price, then needs to approximate
  - do a pass and check out what he will get for the week
  - sit down to eat
  - go back in and carry bags then fill out bags with vendors he checked out previously 
- sometimes just being able to look up eggplant for the week and look up where it is might be nice but just speculation
  - part of the fun is wandering around
- on last trip, purchased: "a crap ton of apples" (specialty), shishito peppers (only one vendor that reliably sells them), eggplant (really good eggplant without seeds), radishes (that you can't get in the store), delicata squash
  - was going to get grapes but were outrageously expensive so went to another market to get the grapes 
- pretty happy with experience at the market 
  - would be nice to know where specific vendors have moved to every single week, and would be nice to know what items will be there that day
  - don't find anything _particularly_ annoying 
  - experience is based on the way he views the situation – community gathering place designed for the community to come together; it's annoying to find produce but encourages community engagement
