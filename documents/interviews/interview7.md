SUMMARY OF USERS: 

User 1 is a regular patron of the farmers market.  He is a professor that lives in Cortland and he and his wife go to the farmer's market
quite frequently.  He likes doing actual shopping here, because he likes to support local businesses and strongly believes that the quality of
food there, especially the produce is much better. He generally shops at the same vendors where he is a regular and has contact with many of the venodrs 
outside of the market.  He will go purchase products from some of the venodrs outside of the market, at their farms, etc.  His favorite part about
the market is the relationships with the vendors, and it is clear he enjoys getting to support and work with them.  He really doesn't have 
any issues with the market, aside from the parking, but he doesn't mind walking when need be. Additionally, he will primarily pay with cash here
because most venors prefer it and it's easier for him.

User 1 didn't have any major issues, but really cared about the vendor relations. That was the most important part to him.

User 2 is a vendor of the farmers market who has been there for 30 years.  He started doing business at the market, because it had a low barrier
of entry, which he needed at the time.  He didn't need a store front or a lot of capital to get started and was able to start with a grill he
found on the street for free.  He enjoys doing business at the market and thinks that he does pretty good business, especially on busy days.  He thinks 
that the bus from cornell to the market helps that.  He has a store now that he tries to get more business for, but sometimes struggles to.
Once he tried advertising in the Cornell Daily Sun, offering a free appetizer for anyone that brought a coupon he put into the Sun into the store,
but nobody came.  He is looking for ways to do better business outside of the market.  Additionally, he prefers cash payments as they don't lose
money on cash payments, but recently started taking cards, b/c most college kids only carry cards.

User 2's biggest issue: advertising. The only way he can advertise is by selling to people and having them bring their friends.
