- 31, research assistant at Cornell
- Came to the market to get breakfast and veggies
- Does grocery shopping here, friends with some vendors and go to others randomly as well
- Knows to come Saturday morning to get chocolate croissant (runs out after 10:30)
- Favorite thing is coming here as early as possible and sitting on the dock and enjoying breakfast
- Least favorite is how crowded it is
- Always get croissants first, then walk around and always get apples from Black Diamond, depends on which vendors are there
- Looks for specific vendors
- Wish the market would shift towards being more eco-friendly; wants it to be more waste free, end single use disposables, get silverware and plates instead
