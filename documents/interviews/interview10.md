Kiersten Rhodes: Kiersten is a senior at Cornell studying government and history. She owns a car and goes to the farmers market a few times a year, usually with friends from school or family and friends from out of town. When she's at the market, she intends on just wandering around and enjoying the atmosphere of the market.

Kiersten Rhodes
- 21, student
- Goes to the market 2-3 times a year with family, friends, boyfriend. 
- Spend 2-3 hours at the market
- Want to visit stalls she knows she likes, whether to get a particular thing to eat or go to the place that sells plants 
- No relationships with the vendors, just knowing them from seeing them there many times 
- Part of the fun of going to the farmer's market is wandering so the plan is to not have a plan 
- If really liked something and wanted to get it frequently, then would buy from a vendor -- but usually things she buys are a one-time thing or novelty; haven't done with any vendor
- Usually buys maple syrup products, fritters, plants, wines/ciders, cutting board; generally not groceries because shops at Wegmans for groceries and because produce is expensive
- Market is far away from where I live and generally will just wander around and not be productive on homework 
- Not an issue finding anything in particular because usually just browsing, but sometimes sell out of things before get there 
- If market was less crowded, improve experience; or lower prices (but understands they need to make a living)
- Favorite thing: the vibe of a fall morning with vendors and cool things you don't usually see at a grocery store; like the fact that it's not just produce that you can find at a grocery store or food you can find at a food truck/restaurants, not just crafts – has all of the above in one place (and alcohol)
- Don't like parking situation or that there's not a bus that goes there
- Also like the live music and the fact that you can sit on the dock and eat your food – chain of events --> place to get your food and eat your food and enjoy, then can get stuff to go
- Something annoying about the market is that there's no map as to which vendors are where, instead they're just mixed in together (i.e. the fruit/craft vendors in diff locations); if there was a map of where different stalls were located that you could grab at the entrance, that would be very helpful 
- Find out about community events through email, friends, facebook events, occasionally postings on campus but not very reliable
- Facebook is not that intuitive on mobile anymore; Instagram might be the most intuitive on the phone (SnapChat is least)
