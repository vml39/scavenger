5. How often do you come to the market? Are there any reasons why you wouldn't come to the market?*

too expensive to come often, hard to reach there, doesn't come too often

6. Do you know any of the vendors at the market? Do you still purchase products from them after the farmers market season is over?
have had conversations with them but never translated to a relationship of getting discounts.  Wish there was a way to maintain contact with vendors even after the end of the season.

yup!  With friends.

often with a group of 2-3 other friends (These friends are ones the interviewee has known for years at cornell).  They usually go for chilling rather than purchasing items.  Only the interviewee really purchases items like cheese specifically.

no list.  Just spontaneous purchases.

Because she doesn't have much of a plan except for hanging out, she doesn't mentally prepare with a list.  In instances where she needs certain items she makes a mental note.

I wish I could get to know vendors more and buy from them even in other seasons.
