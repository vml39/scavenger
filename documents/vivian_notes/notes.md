- 36, lecturer
- goes to the market because need fresh produce for the week 
- doesn't want to spend over $40 on produce but is actually an impulse buyer
  - there's specialty produce that you might not know about until you get there 
  - keeps his own garden
  - ex. when cherries go into season, 4 weeks of early cherries but 1 weekend of specialty cherries (very expensive but only there for a week, so will spend money on this)
  - you don't always know there's something special at the market, need to walk slow and be inquisitive 
- farmer's market is really big, only a handful of vendors he has a steady rapport with (black currant, black diamond farm, peppers)
  - will ask vendors when sees something he doesn't know (but acknowledges type a personality)
  - vendors very receptive to build rapport with clients, will always go to the same vendor for certain items 
  - went to the market one day for apples, then came back with more cash the next day to buy the rest of the apples
  - if you know the vendors, they will work with you to meet outside of the market (go to the farm)
  - need to know the time & place for certain produce (strawberries from 9-9:15 on saturday) --> regular occurrence --> the people at the market at this time are there for a reason
  - knows a lot about the market and about the places 
- would like to know that a specialty item might be at the market because it'll get him to go to the market
- always use cash at the market, don't trust the credit card companies/financial industry
  - credit card company did nothing for this local merchant who's just trying to scrape by, credit card company now gets money from the purchase 
  - pays cash so money will stay in the community and will go to the vendor 
  - vendors definitely prefer cash
  - really dislikes people at the market paying with credit card, lines are really long and it's annoying 
- going to the market is social time for him and husband 
  - if need something at the market, then will go alone 
  - social time -- eat food, sit and chat, sit by the dock, walk by the vendors, run into friends
  - will sit down almost every time but always after purchasing food
- likes to take friends who have never been to the market
  - friend is usually overwhelmed – crowded – but afterwards, experience is always positive
  - really enjoy time there, community aspect, likes uniqueness of items there (weird specialty stuff you wouldn't get elsewhere)
  - cousin felt meh about the market, speculates that she doesn't like to spend a lot of money (both produce and meals) and doesn't cook much for herself 
- established routine 
  - parking is madness so will park in the lot behind Aldi's and walk in 
  - if you know that you have to be somewhere at 9 because there's a line, make a beeline for it; otherwise, 
  - struggle with remembering what this produce looked like and price, then needs to approximate
  - do a pass and check out what he will get for the week
  - sit down to eat
  - go back in and carry bags then fill out bags with vendors he checked out previously 
- sometimes just being able to look up eggplant for the week and look up where it is might be nice but just speculation
  - part of the fun is wandering around
- on last trip, purchased: "a crap ton of apples" (specialty), shishito peppers (only one vendor that reliably sells them), eggplant (really good eggplant without seeds), radishes (that you can't get in the store), delicata squash
  - was going to get grapes but were outrageously expensive so went to another market to get the grapes 
- pretty happy with experience at the market 
  - would be nice to know where specific vendors have moved to every single week, and would be nice to know what items will be there that day
  - don't find anything _particularly_ annoying 
  - experience is based on the way he views the situation – community gathering place designed for the community to come together; it's annoying to find produce but encourages community engagement

Kiersten Rhodes
- 21, student
- Goes to the market 2-3 times a year with family, friends, boyfriend. 
- Spend 2-3 hours at the market
- Want to visit stalls she knows she likes, whether to get a particular thing to eat or go to the place that sells plants 
- No relationships with the vendors, just knowing them from seeing them there many times 
- Part of the fun of going to the farmer's market is wandering so the plan is to not have a plan 
- If really liked something and wanted to get it frequently, then would buy from a vendor -- but usually things she buys are a one-time thing or novelty; haven't done with any vendor
- Usually buys maple syrup products, fritters, plants, wines/ciders, cutting board; generally not groceries because shops at Wegmans for groceries and because produce is expensive
- Market is far away from where I live and generally will just wander around and not be productive on homework 
- Not an issue finding anything in particular because usually just browsing, but sometimes sell out of things before get there 
- If market was less crowded, improve experience; or lower prices (but understands they need to make a living)
- Favorite thing: the vibe of a fall morning with vendors and cool things you don't usually see at a grocery store; like the fact that it's not just produce that you can find at a grocery store or food you can find at a food truck/restaurants, not just crafts – has all of the above in one place (and alcohol)
- Don't like parking situation or that there's not a bus that goes there
- Also like the live music and the fact that you can sit on the dock and eat your food – chain of events --> place to get your food and eat your food and enjoy, then can get stuff to go
- Something annoying about the market is that there's no map as to which vendors are where, instead they're just mixed in together (i.e. the fruit/craft vendors in diff locations); if there was a map of where different stalls were located that you could grab at the entrance, that would be very helpful 
- Find out about community events through email, friends, facebook events, occasionally postings on campus but not very reliable
- Facebook is not that intuitive on mobile anymore; Instagram might be the most intuitive on the phone (Snapchat is least)
