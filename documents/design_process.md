# Discovery & Design Process

Note: Since the beginning of the project, we've modified our app to focus in on one specific need (vendor relations) and have modified our design journey accordingly. Certain parts from our discovery and design phases still have remnants from the first version of our app. Our design revision brainstorm can be found [here](design_revision.md).

## Step 1: User Interviews
The first step in our design process was to interview users so that we could figure out what issues they faced regarding the farmers market. We heavily emphasized this step because we were aware that there existed people in the target audience that we normally wouldn't have access to (community members as opposed to Cornell students) and wanted to gather information on their experience at the market. We conducted over 12 user interviews both at the market and outside of the market. The notes we took during these interviews were essential to the rest of our design process in informing the type of app we hoped to create.

## Step 2: User Behaviors
We thought about user behaviors and what we want to influence
- what would users do
- what prevents them from doing certain things
- etc.

We decided that the behavior we wanted to influence is that users should have more knowledge about what is at the farmer's market before they go.  Our design hopes to influence that behavior and give users a better method of preplanning.  We explained how our design does this in user_behaviors.md.

## Step 3: Brainstorming and Solution Space Analysis
After determining what behavior we wanted to influence, the next step in our persuasive design approach was to meet up and brainstorm ideas for our project so that we could explore our design space a little further. 

Additionally, we conducted a solution space analysis so that we could consider any current technologies/solutions that solve any problems closely related to our design problem.

## Step 4: Sketches
After brainstorming, we had fresh ideas regarding our products design, so we decided to get some of them down on paper and see if we could think through some of our ideas a little better & generate new ideas.  

## Step 5: Paper prototype and Evaluation
The next step in the process was to create a paper prototype of our design and test it with our target audience.  Before we created the paper prototype, though, we met as a team to discuss our initial sketches and discuss what we liked and didn't and what could be improved upon in our design.  For example, we were stuck between two different ideas of how to layout the notes page, so in this meeting we chose a design that we thought would work better for our users. Also, we were able to pick out a general design theme for the paper prototype that we derived from the evaluation of our sketches. Additionally, another big decision we made was whether or not users can make a note about a vendor from the vendors page.  We decided that it would be best for users if they were able to take a note on a vendor from the vendors page and that change is reflected in our paper prototype and our wireframes. We also decided that we did not want to include the "referral" functionality that we sketched out, as it did not fit well within our scenario.

After reviewing our initial sketches, we created the paper prototype based off of the decisions we made regarding how we wanted to improve our design from the initial sketches.  

Once we created the paper prototype, we evaluated our paper prototype with our target audience.  We conducted a total of four user tests and evaluated the two scenarios we created by creating tasks that related to our scenarios.  The users then were asked to complete these task on our paper prototype and we were able to receive feedback on our design. The scenarios were also modified to reflect the new app functionality we brainstormed this week and how this would enhance the value propositions.

## Step 6: Wireframes
Finally, we used the results of our testing to improve upon our design.  We created wireframes using Figma as a substitute for final sketches, so that we can have a design that serves as a blueprint for the next milestone.
