THIS DOCUMENT WILL OUTLINE OUR DESIGN PROCESS

Step 1: User Behaviors
We thought about user behaviors and what we want to influence
- what would users do
- what prevents them from doing certain things
- etc.


We decided that the behavior we wanted to influence is that users should have more knowledge about what is at the farmer's market before they go.  In the user_behaviors markdown file, we described how our design influences our target behavior.

Step 2: Brainstorming and Solution Space Analysis
After determining what behavior we wanted to influence, the next step in our persuasive design approach was to meet up and brainstorm ideas for our project so that we could explore our design space a little further. 

Additionally, we conducted a solution space analysis so that we could consider any current technologies/solutions that solve any problems closely related to our design problem.

Step 3: Sketches
After brainstorming, we had fresh ideas regarding our productgs design, so we decided to get some of them down on paper and see if we could think through some of our ideas a little better & generate new ideas.  

Step 4: Paper prototype and Evaluation
The next step in the process was to create a paper prototype of our design and test it with our target audience.  Before we created the paper prototype, though, we met as a team to discuss our initial sketches and discuss what we liked and didn't and what could be improved upon in our design.  We were able to pick out a general design theme for the paper prototype that we derived from the evaluation of our sketches. 

After reviewing our initial sketches, we created the paper prototype based off of the decisions we made regarding how we wanted to improve our design from the initial sketches.  

Once we created the paper prototype, we evaluated our paper prototype with our target audience.  We conducted a total of four user tests and evaulated the two scenarios we creadted by creating tasks that related to our scenarios.  The users then were asked to complete these task on our paper prototype and we were able to receive feedback on our design.  

Step 5: Wireframes
Finally, we used the results of our testing to improve upon our design.  We created wireframes using Figma as a substitute for final sketeches, so that we can have a design that serves as a blueprint for the next milestone.
