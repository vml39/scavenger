# Value proposition 2 
Many interviewees expressed interest in continuing relations with vendors beyond the market season and emphasizing vendor information will help facilitate and develop these relations. It will also allow users to provide feedback to the vendors.

# Scenario 2
Teresa bought a bottle of pear cider from a vendor named Birdwood Cidery at Ithaca Farmer's Market on Sunday. She went home and found that the cider tasted extremely good, so she wanted to buy two more for a dinner party that she would be holding on Thursday (before the next farmer's market). She then went on to the farmers market web app and found the vendor and its contact information. She called the vendor and was told that she could also buy the cider from the cidery itself, which is located 12 miles away from Ithaca. Therefore, Teresa drove to the Cidery on Monday and bought two more bottles of the pear cider, which she joyfully shared with her friends and family on Thursday.
