<!-- Produce a scenario for each key problem/value proposition -->
<!-- Recall that a scenario = user + task + context. -->

# Value proposition 1
Having inventory lists allows vendors to highlight specialized items and users to pre-plan their visits.

# Scenario 1
Jonathan frequents the Ithaca Farmer's Market and carries quite a bit of produce expertise compared to many of the other market-goers. As a result, he absolutely loves going to see all the specialty items that various vendors sell for a limited time. On Saturday, he visited and found a vendor that sold a special type of grapes. He purchased them being intrigued, and when he tried them he absolutely loved them. So he went onto the farmer's market web app, and looked through  the vendors' inventory lists. There, he found that one other vendor also sells this special type of grape. So when the next weekend came, he went to the farmer's market and stopped at those two vendors' stands first, so that he could buy the special type of grapes from both vendors to see which he liked better for future reference.

# Value proposition 2 
Many interviewees expressed interest in continuing relations with vendors beyond the market season and emphasizing vendor information will help facilitate and develop these relations. It will also allow users to provide feedback to the vendors.

# Scenario 2
Teresa bought a bottle of pear cider from a vendor named Birdwood Cidery at Ithaca Farmer's Market on Sunday. She went home and found that the cider tasted extremely good, so she wanted to buy two more for a dinner party that she would be holding on Thursday (before the next farmer's market). She then went on to the farmers market web app and found the vendor and its contact information. She called the vendor and was told that she could also buy the cider from the cidery itself, which is located 12 miles away from Ithaca. Therefore, Teresa drove to the Cidery on Monday and bought two more bottles of the pear cider, which she joyfully shared with her friends and family on Thursday.
