Progress view:

![Initial Progress Sketch](map.jpg)
![Levels](map2.jpg)

The progress page was created after revising our design and redesigning our app. The first image is our initial design for a "map" where the user would complete tasks to level up and earn badges. The second image shows the different modals that would pop up and how the user would level up in the game.
