Vendor login: These are different ways of navigating to the vendor login. We considered how visible we wanted the login to be and decided that since vendors are not part of our target audience, we would have a separate page for the vendor login that isn't included anywhere in the main navigation or on the site.

Update inventory view: There were two different views considered for how to allow the vendor to update their inventory. First, as a form, which may be more intuitive for the vendor, and second, (assuming that the inventory was laid out as a table). We decided on the first option so the form would act more as a conversation with the vendor.
