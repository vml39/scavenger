## Takeaways and Debriefing
- The user spoke about how she struggled to see how she had gotten a badge, as well as how many she had, and said that this should be clarified.
- Also mentioned that the visual difference between the progress and vendors page felt a little "off"

- In future edits, we should ensure that we have a way to display all the badges the user has so he/she can look back and view their "accomplishments," making the persuasive design even more effective. It would be even more helpful if each badge had either some symbol to show how it was received, or some way to click on it and show a description.
- Similarly to user 2, we should streamline the designs between the two pages so it looks much more cohesive.
- Even though the user did not say it outright, I noticed that she was slightly confused between the meaning of "Share" and "Referral" as their meanings could  be misconstrued to be a little similar. We should definitely clarify this by choosing a different label that is more contrasting to the others.
