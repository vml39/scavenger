## Takeaways and Debriefing
- User mentioned that she couldn't go back and see previous levels below the current page which was frustrating as she was trying to figure out how she got certain badges and how many she had.
- Pointed out that on the page where the user could scan a QR code, there was no "Complete task" button like the other tasks to indicate that she had completed the level. Mentioned that this was confusing

- In our future edits, we should make sure that things like the "completed task" button are consistent in all our tasks, and maintain consistency throughout our app to avoid confusion
- Should have a way to display all the badges the user has so he/she can look back and view their "accomplishments," making the persuasive design even more effective
