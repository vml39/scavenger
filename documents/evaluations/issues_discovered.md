THIS DOCUMENT WILL OUTLINE THE KEY ISSUES WE DISCOVERED DURING USER TESTING AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THEM 
- Key takeaways from each individual user were included at the bottom of each user testing page, but this page will combine them and sum them up to outline clear future tasks

1. BADGES- All the users mentioned that they would appreciate more clarification in their badges, rather than having them just marked on the page. For example, they would like to be able to go back and see how many badges they had collected thus far, and how each one was obtained. In the future, we should implement this, as it will help make our use of gamification in our persuasive design to be more effective, since it would likely keep the users more engaged by seeing their previous "accomplishments". 

2. DESIGN CONSISTENCY- A few other users also pointed out some inconsistencies that we should pay attention to. 
    - The first one was how in some of the tasks, you had to click "Complete Task" to indicate that you had finished the task and are ready to level up. However in other tasks, this button was not present, and they were not sure if they had to somehow indicate they were ready to level up, and how to do so. Streamlining this throughout our app would ensure more consistency and intuitiveness in how to level up.
    - The second lack of consistency was in the styling, which only a couple users pointed out, but I felt it was worth noting. Visually, the vendors page and progress page look a little different, as if they were even part of two different apps. I think it would be worth it in the future to pay more attention to the visual styling details to try and make certain elements appear through both pages, so that users can see they form one cohesive app. This could come in the form of color scheme, shapes, font, etc. 

3. WORDING- A couple users were confused when they came cross having to share a photo of something, or refer a friend. This was because the names of the tasks "Share" and "Referral" could be confusing, since referring a vendor could also be thought of as sharing a vendor's information with a friend. Thus, in the future we should better clarify the names of tasks so that users don't get confused, and don't have to click on one to realize it isn't the right one before going to the other task. This will be tricky with the single-word labels on each task button, but it can be done. For example,we could consider changing "Share" to "Social" which would indicate having to do with social media. We hope in the future we will also be able to make different tasks appear randomly on varying levels, and in doing so we should make sure the wording of each one is clear.
