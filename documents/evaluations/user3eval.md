## Takeaways and Debriefing
- The user mentioned that it would be helpful if there were a way to scroll down to see previous rounds (like in Candy Crush), and some way to see how each badge was displayed, as well as how many she had. Suggested maybe allow users to click on a badge to see how it was gotten.
- Said overall it was intuitive, just the badge part was a bit confusing.
- Also mentioned that the "Share" button in the tasks to choose was a bit ambiguous in meaning, and it was slighly hard to differentiate between sharing and referring, since they could mean the same thing.

- In future edits, we should ensure that we have a way to display all the badges the user has so he/she can look back and view their "accomplishments," making the persuasive design even more effective. It would be even more helpful if each badge had either some symbol to show how it was received, or some way to click on it and show a description.
- Should also clarify the task names to make sure there is no confusion between more than one task.
