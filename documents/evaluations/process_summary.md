# THIS DOCUMENT WILL OUTLINE OUR USER TESTING PROCESS AND PLANNING

TARGET AUDIENCE: Our first stemp in planning our user testing was identifying our target audience, which we determined after carrying out our interviews. During the interview process, a few users mentioned that they were frequent farmer's market visitors. When further discussing what made their farmer's market experience so enjoyable, most of the frequent farmer's market goers said that the positive friendships they had made with many vendors largely contributed to that. They had gotten to speak to and get to know multiple vendors relatively well as a result of going regularly, and formed close connections with them. They enjoyed going back every week and seeing their favorite vendors, the specialty items they would have each season, etc.  A couple users even mentioned that they were able to do business with those vendors outside of the market as well, which further made the experience more personal and enjoyable. On the other hand, other interviewees said that they had struggled to form friendships or connections  with the vendors at the market, as maybe they weren't quite regulars, or were more shy. However, they expressed interest in getting  more engaged with the community of vendors at the market, and were very interested in fostering stronger relationships with the people they were buying their goods from. So in the end, our target audience became that group of users- those who enjoy going to the farmer's  market, but for whatever reason have struggled to explore the wide array of vendors the market has to offer, and make connections with them.

THE SCENARIOS: From the target audience, we came up with our persona- Ben, who we used to help model our scenarios and tasks after (you can read about our persona in detail in our persona.md file)

# SCENARIO 1:  
This first scenario aims to allow the user to choose 1 of 3 tasks in order to level up in the game, in order to build vendor relations.

Jonathan frequents the Ithaca Farmer's Market and is a frequent user of our app. He is wandering around the market with his friends browsing the items. He has been to the market a few times already and knows a couple vendors, but is still relatively unfamiliar with most of them. He uses this app to find new ways to facilitate new conversations with various vendors, such as the "speak to a new vendor" task. After doing so, he levels up and gets a badge. He realizes he really likes this vendor's products, and ends up favoriting the vendor in the app.

# SCENARIO 2:
This second scenario aims to allow the user to see a list of vendors and favorite the ones they have visited and liked. This not only allows them to remember which vendors they like and want to visit again, but will be helpful in the "referral" tasks of some of the levels, where they will need to refer a vendor to a friend.

While Emily is playing the game, one of the tasks she must complete to level up asks her to scan the QR code of a new vendor. She decides to do so with Indian Creek Farm- while she is doing that, she ends up striking up a conversation with the vendors, and they tell her that they are selling a special type of mushroom that is only here for a limited time, and only sold by a few vendors. She is intrigued and thus buys the mushrooms. When she goes home and eats them, she absolutely loves them. She wants to remember this vendor for the next time she goes to the market, so she opens up the app and goes to the list of vendors, where she then favorites Indian Creek Farm by clicking the star next to it. 

# USER TESTING:
We then had our users whom we tested on walk through each scenario, and evaluated them based on how intuitive it seemed to carry out the tasks, and whether it solved the issues identified with the target audience. After the users walked through the scenarios, we would ask them for any feedback based on how they felt their experience was with the app, which would be taken into account in our future revisions in addition to the notes taken by the tester observing the user during the session.
