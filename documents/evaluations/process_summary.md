THIS DOCUMENT WILL OUTLINE OUR USER TESTING PROCESS AND PLANNING

TARGET AUDIENCE: Our first stemp in planning our user testing was identifying our target audience, which we determined after carrying out our interviews. During the interview process, a few users mentioned that they were frequent farmer's market visitors. When further discussing what made their farmer's market experience so enjoyable, most of the frequent farmer's market goers said that the positive friendships they had made with many vendors largely contributed to that. They had gotten to speak to and get to know multiple vendors relatively well as a result of going regularly, and formed close connections with them. They enjoyed going back every week and seeing their favorite vendors, the specialty items they would have each season, etc.  A couple users even mentioned that they were able to do business with those vendors outside of the market as well, which further made the experience more personal and enjoyable. On the other hand, other interviewees said that they had struggled to form friendships or connections  with the vendors at the market, as maybe they weren't quite regulars, or were more shy. However, they expressed interest in getting  more engaged with the community of vendors at the market, and were very interested in fostering stronger relationships with the people they were buying their goods from. So in the end, our target audience became that group of users- those who enjoy going to the farmer's  market, but for whatever reason have struggled to explore the wide array of vendors the market has to offer, and make connections with them.

THE SCENARIOS: From the target audience, we came up with our persona- Ben, who we used to help model our scenarios and tasks after (you can read about our persona in detail in our persona.md file)
