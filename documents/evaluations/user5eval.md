## Takeaways and Debriefing
- The user, like all the others, said she struggled to see how she had gotten a badge, as well as how many she had. 
- Also mentioned that the way to complete a task should be consistent across all tasks.

- In future edits, we should ensure that we have a way to display all the badges the user has so he/she can look back and see how many she has, as well as how they were obtained.
