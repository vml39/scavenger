User 1: Kevin Sarmiento- Master's student in CEE

## Round 1

1. You want to check how many badges you have.
    - Saw that the most recent badge came at level 10, and thought that it meant he had 10 badges, but it was just the 10th level. 
2. Complete the next task in your list to post a photo of a specialty item.
    - Did not necessarily realize that "Share" meant to post a photo, but figured it out after playing around on the app.
3. You end up really liking this vendor- you want to find their information on the app.
    - Easily went to vendors page to find the vendor, then clicked on their profile to view more information.
4. You favorite this vendor so that you can remember them for future visits.
    - Knew to click the heart to favorite.
5. View all your favorite vendors.
    - Had seen they were at the top of the vendors page before so knew to go back there.

## Round 2

1. Complete the first task in your list to scan the vendor's QR code. (The user will get a badge, level up). 
    - Done with ease.
2. Refer a friend to your favorite vendor, Apple Farm.
    - Knew to go to the referral button and refer a friend
3. Post a picture with this fruit using one of the hashtags on the list. (User levels up).
    - Knew to click on "Share" based on previous task, and used one of the hashtags
4. Check how you got your first badge.
    - Did not know how to and didn't know where to go to try to figure it out. 
5. You really like this vendor, Apple Farm, that sells apples. You want to find their contact info so you can ask them about their apple cider recipe.
    - Did not struggle to find the vendor in  the vendors page and find their contact info
6. Favorite this vendor. 
    - Knew to click on the heart to favorite

## Scenario 1
- Done with ease, except used one of the available 3 tasks on the page we coded.

## Scenario 2
- Done with ease.

## Takeaways and Debriefing
- Like user 1, he mentioned that he couldn't see how he got his badges and how many he had, at least not intuitively. Suggested we make it clearer and easier to find. 
- Said that the vendors page and progress page were strikingly different visually, and suggested we make it flow better.

- In our future edits, we may want to consider how to make the styling between the vendors page and the progress page more cohesive, or seem more like one single app. Right now, the styling is rather different and does not necessarily present the look of a singular app.
- Should have a way to display all the badges the user has so he/she can look back and view their "accomplishments," making the persuasive design even more effective
