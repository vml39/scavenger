# Rationale

Our app's purpose is to facilitate relations between the farmers market patrons and the vendors, as well as encourage new relationships between patrons and vendors. This directly addresses the key problem we identified where frequent visitors didn't explore other vendors as much and infrequent visitors had trouble developing deeper relationships with vendors or discovering new vendors. All users are encouraged to meet new vendors and share these vendors through the activities that they're given to level up or earn badges. This sort of gamification incentivizes the user because it requires that users are intrinsically motivated on some level, but the game's levels and badges will also encourage them by giving them actionable ways to explore the market further. In addition, by providing a list of vendors and allowing users to favorite certain vendors, the user now has a way to contact any vendor beyond the market, and to develop relationships with certain vendors that they really like.
