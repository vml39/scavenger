Small Behaviors to Influence:

1. Get people to know what specific vendors sell
What prevents this behavior?
- Mainly ability.  There is currently no way to easily access that information on vendors.  You either need to be a regular at the market and know who sells what are just show up and walk around until you find what you're looking for.

2. Get people to make contact with vendors
What prevents this behavior?
- Motivation.  Could be driven by social awkwardness or the fact that people are trying to enjoy time with friends and family during the market or maybe they just don't like going out of their way to find something out

3. Give people a better idea of what is at the farmer's market before they go as a method of pre-planning
What prevents this behavior?
- A mix of motivation, ability, and a well timed prompt.  First, people just might not care enough to find out what vendors have, because it might not matter to them.  Maybe they just go for the social/aesthetic aspects.  Next, people may not have the resources to find out what is there.  If they never went before or can't remember, there's no way to find detailed information on that without going.  Finally, it is possible that they plan on just going just for the sake of going and don't realize that it would be helpful to know what is going to be there.  If they had some sort of reminder or prompt before they go, they might think it would be valuable to find out what is there.

Relative Examples to Consider:
- points for checking out different places (like snapchat score)
- scorecard of vendors contact info (get all vendors, get something free)
- each time you refer someone to a vendor or item you get a "punch" in your "punch card" (like how coffee places here offer punch cards
- levels of "kind of shopper" at the market (newbie, familiar, regular, insane, etc.)
