Small Behaviors to Influence:

1. Get people to know what specific vendors sell
What prevents this behavior?
- Mainly ability.  There is currently no way to easily access that information on vendors.  You either need to be a regular at the market and know who sells what are just show up and walk around until you find what you're looking for.

2. Get people to make contact with vendors
What prevents this behavior?
- Motivation.  Could be driven by social awkwardness or the fact that people are trying to enjoy time with friends and family during the market or maybe they just don't like going out of their way to find something out

3. Give people a better idea of what is at the farmer's market before they go as a method of pre-planning
What prevents this behavior?
- A mix of motivation, ability, and a well timed prompt.  First, people just might not care enough to find out what vendors have, because it might not matter to them.  Maybe they just go for the social/aesthetic aspects.  Next, people may not have the resources to find out what is there.  If they never went before or can't remember, there's no way to find detailed information on that without going.  Finally, it is possible that they plan on just going just for the sake of going and don't realize that it would be helpful to know what is going to be there.  If they had some sort of reminder or prompt before they go, they might think it would be valuable to find out what is there.

Relative Examples to Consider:
- points for checking out different places (like snapchat score)
- scorecard of vendors contact info (get all vendors, get something free)
- each time you refer someone to a vendor or item you get a "punch" in your "punch card" (like how coffee places here offer punch cards
- levels of "kind of shopper" at the market (newbie, familiar, regular, insane, etc.)


HOW OUR DESIGN SOLVES THIS BEHAVIOR:

The primary behavior we decided to target was behavior #3, "Give people a better idea of what is at the farmer's market before they go as a method of pre-planning."  Here's how our design influences this behavior:
- First, we gave people the resources to find out what is at the farmers market.  With our design, they know what vendors will be there and what they will be selling.  All that information they need is easily accessible with our design.
- Next, our design allows users to know what is going on at the market, and can provide them with a way to keep track of information so that they can realize it is helpful to know what is going on there.  The notes page  allows our users to jot down relevant information that they can refer to later, so they will realize that going to the farmer's market with information or personal notes will provide a much better time.  This will allow them to improve their experience at the market.
- Finally, in the future, we plan on adding specials and other exciting information about the market (that rotates on a weekly basis) on the home page. This special information will provide users with the motivation to find out what different vendors have, because if users know that this "special" may only be around for this weekend, they'd be encouraged to find out what/where it is so that they don't miss out!
